                            My name is Jeremy Sallee
                            and I’m a Designer. I have 
                            a passion for simple interfaces. I also love coding. Like all French people I live 
                            off baguettes, champagne &amp; foie gras evidently! I also say <i>ohlala</i>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’ve always loved solving problems. Being good at science, I graduated and worked 
                            as an electronics engineer before teaching myself design. Sometimes I like to 
                            <a href="http://salleedesign.com/blog/">write</a>		  		 about what I do in life and at work. I also like to take 
                            <a class="closemenu" href="http://salleedesign.com/photography/">pictures that tell stories</a>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am currently working at <a href="http://nutanix.com" target="_blank">Nutanix</a> 
                            as a Designer. If you want, you can view my

                            I show designs on

                            Being an avid photographer, I take snapshots with my phone on 
                            <a target="_blank" href="http://salleedesign.vsco.co/">VSCO</a> and use my big DSLR 
                            to put pictures on <a target="_blank" href="http://500px.com/JeremySallee">500px</a> 
                            and videos on <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/user5671456">Vimeo</a>.

                        <p>
                            I traveled a very atypical path, both personally and professionally. I was born in 
                            Cameroon and raised in 6 different countries and 3 continents. I speak <i>English</i>, 
                            <i>French</i> and <i>Spanish</i> fluently. I have been good at math and science 
                            since my childhood, studying and obtaining a Master’s Degree in <i>Electrical Engineering</i>.
                            After working in that field for a couple of years, I decided to <i>learn design</i> 
                            on my own and have been working as a product designer and front end developer since July, 2007.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the greatest strenghs about being a designer with an engineer background is 
                            that not only I can handle the graphical aspects of a project, but I can also 
                            fully understand, participate and even lead the  technical aspects of those same projects.
